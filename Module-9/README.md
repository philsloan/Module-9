# <# Professional README Generator Starter Code>

## Description

This is the project for Module-9 UC Berkeley. I was motivated to do well and get a good grade. I built this project to understand node.js and its way of performing. I hope that this project will prove my knowledge of the module. I feel I have learned even more when it comes to the field of javascript
